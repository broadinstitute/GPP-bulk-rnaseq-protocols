# Differential Gene Expression Analysis

There are numberous tools to test for differential gene expression (DGE), two of which we will explore here - [Limma](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402510/) and [DESeq2](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8). See Limma and DeSeq2 (`.md`) protocols in this folder for examples on how to use both libraries. 

Prior to using either of the tools, an analyst should have an understanding of how to create a design matrix that is appropriate for the experiment. This [guide](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/RNAseq123/inst/doc/designmatrices.html), written by the creators of Limma and EdgeR, provides a thorough explanation of how to do so.
